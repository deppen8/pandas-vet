# Installation

`pandas-vet` is a plugin for `flake8`. If you don't have `flake8` already, it will install automatically when you install `pandas-vet`.

The plugin is on PyPI and can be installed with:

```bash
pip install pandas-vet
```

It can also be installed with `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pandas-vet
```

`pandas-vet` is tested under Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 as defined in our [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/deppen8/pandas-vet/blob/main/.github/workflows/testing.yml)
